    <h2>Byeongho Kim</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Byeongho Kim and I'm from South Korea. This is my fourth semester and I'm majoring in
        Computer Science. I took 3 semesters on campus, but I'm currently in my country for rest for a while.</p>
    <p>I really love outdoor things such as hiking, biking, walking, and traveling. I'm really excited to travel around
        my country this semester!</p>
    <p>To talk about my plan... I've decided to learn coding since middle school, and I've really loved doing it. So
        I will get my Computer Science degree and start my own business. The whole purpose of it is to travel the world
        while doing my business with my laptop. I'm really looking forward to learning how to make websites so that
        someday I can make fancy websites about my business.</p>
