                <h4>EDM is an abbreviation of Electronic Dance Music, and is a generic term for electronic music used in commercial party culture such as clubs and festivals.
                    The chart called Dance has already been individually classified on US Billboard and UK official charts and has been awarded related awards.
                   
                   After 2010, the term EDM was used to re-examine the rave/festival culture in which the American music market and media are reviving.
                   Electronic music is exceptionally diverse in sub-genres and classifications than other genres. 
                   This is due to the fact that electronic music has multiple origins and, over time, blends simultaneously with various regional and cultural factors.</h4>
