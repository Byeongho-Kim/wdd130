      <h3>What Is EDM?</h3>
      <p>
        EDM is an abbreviation of Electronic Dance Music, and is a generic term for electronic music used in commercial party culture such as clubs and festivals. The chart called Dance has already been individually classified on US Billboard and UK official charts and has been awarded related awards.

After 2010, the term EDM was used to re-examine the rave/festival culture in which the American music market and media are reviving.
Electronic music is exceptionally diverse in sub-genres and classifications than other genres. This is due to the fact that electronic music has multiple origins and, over time, blends simultaneously with various regional and cultural factors.

The basic classification criterion is the drum beat that is applied to the song, and the frame of a large genre is mostly changed according to the drum beat and BPM, and the detailed genre differs according to various factors such as the sound source used and the music composition format.

Genres below 80 BPM include dubstep, trap, and future bass. Genres between 80 and 120 BPM include house, trance, house, glitch hop, future bass, halftime drum and bass, and drumstep. Between 120 and 170 BPM are trance, house, hardstyle, and garage, and above 170 BPM are hardcore techno, jungle, drum and bass.

      <h3>Famous Festivals</h3>
      <p>
        Tomorrowland, which has always kept its name as one of the world's EDM festivals, is held over two weeks in July in the city of Boom, Belgium. Every year, more than 400,000 people from all over the world gather for Tomorrowland. The two-week festival welcomes audiences with over 20 stages and over 1,000 top artists. It is no exaggeration to say that you can meet DJs from all over the world.

Tomorrowland is loved not only by the world's best lineup, but also by creating a fairy-tale atmosphere that is called the dream garden of adults. Each year, the main stage is designed with a new story concept, and the finale is decorated with great videos and performances.

Electronic Daisy Carnival, better known as EDC, is considered the largest EDM festival in the United States. Held annually at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway Stadium, the festival attracts over 400,000 people. Under the theme of ‘Carnival’, you can meet not only electronic music, but also a variety of rides, fireworks, and performances that will leave you feeling splendid. In addition, like Tomorrowland, a sophisticated and beautiful stage created with one theme every year amplifies people's expectations.

In addition to Las Vegas, EDC can be found at various venues such as Orlando, Mexico, and Japan. However, not all EDCs are created equal. If you haven't been to EDC Las Vegas, you haven't experienced the real EDC yet. The sub stage of EDC Las Vegas, which is much bigger than the main stage of EDC Korea, can the stage be this big? It makes me think of it. EDC Las Vegas is a festival that I personally recommend the most. Don't miss the fantastic fireworks show that fills the night sky as the finale!

The Ultra Music Festival, held every March in Miami, USA, marks the beginning of the EDM festival season. As it is the first large-scale festival, it is also a festival that is highly anticipated by electronic music fans by introducing new music by many artists. Ultra Music Festival, which has 8 stages and a lineup of world-class DJs, does not hold a festival with a story or concept like Tomorrowland or EDC, but you can feel a wilder atmosphere!

Ultra is also known as the most global franchise festival. It has become the most popular festival in the world, including Ultra Korea, Europe, Singapore, China, and Australia. However, the Ultra Miami boasts the largest scale among them and sets itself apart from other Ultras with its overwhelming lineup. If you're a true fan of festivities ready for spring, kick off this year's festivities with Miami's Ultra!

Held every year in June, for three days in Walibi Holland, the Netherlands, Defcon is a festival that mainly deals with one of the EDM genres, hard style and hardcore music. Defcon, which has been steadily making a name for itself with the highest number of audiences of 100,000 in 2016, is a festival where you can run around and play like crazy, befitting the name of Hard Style. It's not chaotic or dangerous. Although the Netherlands is a drug law country, marijuana is also regulated within the festival.

Defcon's highlight, POWER HOUR, is a 60-minute period in which tens of thousands of people can play together to insanely fast hard-style music. At this time, DJs and MCs come out on stage to wave flags or make comments, interacting with the audience and having fun. Another highlight of this POWER HOUR and DEFCON The Endshow and Closing Ceremony are also held on the RED stage, the main DEFCON stage, so we recommend you to go to the RED stage!
